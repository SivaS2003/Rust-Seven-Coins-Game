# Rust-Seven-Coins-Game
a basic coin game, to practice using the Rust programming language

this program isn't really meant for the game itself, more as a way to apply rust programming

coins game:

both players have 0 coins
the person who gets 7 coins first loses

each player rolls a dice, and the number they get is the number of coins they will get. the player can choose to:

take the coins: the player will not have to take the risks of doing anything else with the coins that could backfire.
give the coins: their opponent has to take the coins, but when the opponent rolls the dice, coins will be taken from what you gave them equal to the roll.
throw the coins: you can offer to throw the coins away and neither player has to take coins coins. if the opponent refuses, both players get that amount of coins.

currently, the code is very messy and unorganized, will try and optimize.
